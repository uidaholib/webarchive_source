# About {{ site.title }}

To ensure continued access to the unique born-digital content made available on the university website, University of Idaho Library captures university communications in their original web context on an annual basis.
Select material from these harvests are made available in our digital collections.
For more information, additional web archive material, or to view web content closer to how it was originally intended please contact [Special Collections and Archives](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/contactus.html).
Collections currently include newsletters, such as the [Friday Letter](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/fridayletter/), and news items, such as [UI News](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/uinews/index.html).

*Please note,* the archived web pages and email messages are in a variety of formats and may not display as originally intended. 
Some images, links, and functionality may be broken or out of date.

For current information, please visit [University of Idaho](http://www.uidaho.edu/).

## Web Archiving 

Content on the web is in constant flux: rapidly appearing, updating, and disappearing. 
However, many of these intentionally time-limited, spontaneous, or ephemeral cultural artifacts may hold enduring value and relevance to the historical record. 
As the web becomes the primary means of disseminating information, libraries and archives around the world are challenged with preserving this resource for current and future generations. 
As with all digital information, it is at-risk without active [digital preservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_preservation) (see [Why Digital Preservation is Important for Everyone](https://youtu.be/qEmmeFFafUs)).

The <a href="https://archive.org/about">Internet Archive</a> has been leading the field of web archiving since 1996, developing the technical means to harvest, store, preserve, and access archived web content on a huge scale. 
In 2003 they helped form the <a href="http://netpreserve.org/about-us">International Internet Preservation Consortium (IIPC)</a> to support collaborative efforts to improve standards, tools, and best practices for web archiving.

For example, the <a href="timeline.html" >UI Library Web History Timeline</a> highlights the major redesigns over the last two decades as captured by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970218140532/http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/">Internet Archive</a>. 
To provide authentic access to archived web content, the Wayback Machine renders the original functionality in the user's web browser with hyperlinks automatically redirected to archived sources rather than the live web.
